        "## Project: Molecular Thermodynamics & Melting Temperature ($T_m$)\n",
        "The **Melting Temperature ($T_m$)** is the temperature at which 50% of the DNA is double-stranded and 50% is dissociated into single strands.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🎯 Objective\n",
        "Calculate the melting temperature ($T_m$) of a DNA primer using various thermodynamic models to determine its suitability for PCR.\n",
        "\n",
        "### 🛠️ Key Concepts\n",
        "* **Wallace Rule:** A simplified formula for short sequences:\n",
        "  $$T_m = 2(A + T) + 4(G + C)$$\n",
        "  *Usage: mt.Tm_Wallace(seq)*\n",
        "* **Nearest Neighbor (NN):** A more robust calculation that accounts for the interaction between adjacent bases and the entropy/enthalpy of the stack.\n",
        "*Usage: mt.Tm_NN(seq)*\n",
        "* **Salt Dependency:** Understanding how cation concentration (like $Na^+$) stabilizes the negative backbone of DNA, thereby increasing $T_m$.<br>\n",
        "*Usage: mt.Tm_Wallace(seq, Na = NaConc)*\n",
        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "### 📓 Notes\n",
        "* **Observations:** Notice that the Nearest Neighbor method usually gives a different result than the Wallace rule. For professional lab work, NN is preferred.\n",
        "* **Application:** When designing a pair of PCR primers, you want their $T_m$ values to be within $1-2^\\circ\\text{C}$ of each other.\n",
